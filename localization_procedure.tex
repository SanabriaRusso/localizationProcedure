\begin{abstract}
\boldmath Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of nodes that gather metrics like temperature, pollution or pressure from events generated by external entities. Localization in WSNs is paramount, given that the collected metrics must be related to the place of occurrence. This document presents an alternative way towards localization in randomly deployed WSNs based on the composability of localization protocols. Results show a totally distributed localization procedure that achieves a higher number of located nodes than the conventional, individual execution of localization protocols while maintaining the same low levels of battery consumption.

% Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are very much like the skin of out bodies: composed of sensor terminals that gather metrics from events generated by external entities. Localization in WSNs is paramount, given that the collected metrics must be related to the place of occurrence. 
% 
% Usually this done by placing sensor nodes at known locations, but random deployments scenarios are pushing the need for more flexible and effective ways of locating nodes. There are several factors that must be taken into account for an effective localization and most of them are related to battery consumption and localization algorithms's convergence time, which in turn translates to number of GPS-enabled nodes and desired localization accuracy.
